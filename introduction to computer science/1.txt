Introduction

- Two sets of knowledge

	- Declaritive ( statements of fact. a good healthcare plan improves quality of healthcare )
			  ( y is the sqroot of x if and only if y*y=x                                 )

	- Imperative  ( how to solve for something    )
			  ( how to make a cake            )
			  ( start with g,
			    if g*g is close enough to x,
			    g new = (g old + x/g old) / 2 )

	- Algorithm   ( how to perform a computation         )
			  ( algorithm converged when it's halted )

	- Fixed program computers ( designed to do very specific things )
					  ( solved systems of linear equations  ) 

	- Stored Program Computer ( instructions are same as data ) 

	- Interpreter ( execute any legal set of instructions ) 


Python
	- Syntax           ( which sequences of chars and symbols constitute a well formed string )
	- Static Semantics ( which wellformed strings have meaning ) 
	- Semantics        ( what that meaning is )
